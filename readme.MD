## About This Repository
Welcome! 👋  
This repository contains my **hands-on Terraform projects** where I build and manage AWS infrastructure using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** best practices.  

Here you will find examples ranging from basic EC2 and S3 setup to advanced **VPCs, modules, multiple environments, and remote state management**. The goal is to demonstrate a **scalable, modular, and professional IaC workflow**.

## Key Topics & Projects Covered

### 1️⃣ Basics of Terraform & IaC
- Advantages of Infrastructure as Code  
- Terraform installation and setup  
- Creating EC2 instances and Security Groups  
- Using **variables, data types, conditions, loops**, and **count-based resources**  
- Outputs for resources like EC2 public IP and S3 bucket names  


---

### 2️⃣ Intermediate Concepts
- **Route53 DNS setup** along with EC2  
- Use of **locals, data sources**, and reusable **modules**  
- Understanding **Terraform state**, **remote state** with S3 and DynamoDB  
- Loops and conditional resource creation

### 3️⃣ Advanced Topics & Best Practices
- Managing **multiple environments** with **workspaces** and **separate repositories**  
- Module development for **VPCs, Security Groups, and Bastion hosts**  
- VPC concepts: Subnets, Internet Gateways, Route Tables, VPC Peering  
- **SSM Parameter Store** for secrets and configurations  
- Writing **security group rules** and using **open-source modules**
